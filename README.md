# Hackathon-Game

Problem Statement:

In the modern age, financial literacy is more important than ever. Yet, many students and young adults lack the foundational knowledge and skills to navigate the complex world of personal finance and investment. Traditional methods of teaching finance, such as lectures or textbooks, can often be dry, dense, and disengaging. There's a need for an interactive and engaging tool that not only educates individuals about the principles of finance and investment but also allows them to practice and simulate real-world financial decisions without real-world risks.

Objective:

Develop an educational board game, "Market Master," that simulates the financial market's dynamics. Players should learn about different investment vehicles, understand market fluctuations, and strategize based on market conditions. The game should be accessible for beginners but offer enough depth to remain challenging for those with some financial background. By the end of the game, players should have a better understanding of investment strategies, market analysis, and financial decision-making.
